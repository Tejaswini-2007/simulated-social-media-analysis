 📁 Project Structure

- **Data Generation**: Creates synthetic data with random likes and categories.
- **Data Cleaning**: Removes duplicates and nulls, ensures correct datatypes.
- **Exploration**: Uses Pandas and Seaborn to explore and visualize data.
- **Insights**: Calculates average likes per category and visualizes distribution.
